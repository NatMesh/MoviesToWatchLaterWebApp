This is a web app built in C# using ASP.NET Core Razer pages. As an avid movie watcher friends/family recommend me movies to watch often. So as a way to keep an ongoing list that I can refer to when looking for something to watch I built this web app. It's a CRUD app where I can add movies with their title, lead actors, and category. Once I finally watch that movie/show I can delete it from the list.
